# Editor

Editor is an HTML / CSS / JS code editor that renders what you type in real-time. It's also my [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) sandbox that I'm currently using to learn the capabilities of this library.

## About

I have a strange fascination with text editors. My current favorites are [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) (for the desktop) and I also use online text editors such as [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). I've been exploring the inner workings of websites like these and decided to create my own version of an online code playground.
